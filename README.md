# Open Source Party Declaration of Principle

The [Open Source Party](http://opensourceparty.net/) is a political movement that derives both inspiration and methods from Open Source software principles. The fundamental Open Source principles as they apply to this party, where laws, policies, and political processes are seen as a body of code, are:

> Transparency: the code, and any changes to the code, are visible and understandable.
> The code is accessible and modifiable.
> Inclusion: anyone can access the code and propose modifications, which may be accepted by democratic consensus, or by
> executive decision in a framework decided democratically.

As a matter of scope, we limit our activity to the United States but encourage development of a global Open Source party that creates models to work in other national contexts.

Our effort is meant have a democratizing transformative effect that is fair to all. Weâ€™re committed to uses of technology to create platforms that will support our mission.
